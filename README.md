# Turn-Based Chess-Like Game with WebSocket Communication

## Overview

This project is a turn-based chess-like game where two players compete on a 5x5 grid using various characters. The game uses WebSocket for real-time communication between clients and the server. The web client is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the server-side logic is implemented in Python.

### Key Components

1. **Server (Python)**
   - Implements game logic and WebSocket server.
   - Processes game moves and maintains the game state.

2. **WebSocket Layer**
   - Manages real-time communication between the server and clients.
   - Handles events such as game initialization, moves, and state updates.

3. **Web Client (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
   - Provides a web-based interface for interacting with the game.
   - Uses WebSocket to communicate with the server.
   - Renders the game board, handles user inputs, and displays game state.
